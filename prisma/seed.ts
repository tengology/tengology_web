        "A mint-green fluorite nugget, faceted into a soft octagonal silhouette, anchors each earring with cool, glassy translucence. Above it sits a hand-wrapped cluster of tiny rondelles in lavender, grey-blue, leaf green and champagne — the natural colour range of fluorite and amethyst gathered into one bloom.\n\nWorn, the larger stone swings gently while the cluster catches the light from every angle, scattering soft glints of gold wire between the beads.\n\nFluorite is traditionally carried as a stone of focus — said to settle a busy mind and draw scattered thoughts back to centre.\n\nFinished on 14k gold-plated sterling silver (S925) ear hooks, which are hypoallergenic, with gold-plated alloy findings.

Above it, a hand-wrapped cluster of faceted rondelles tumbles in bright aqua amazonite and misty grey-blue aquamarine — like surf settling over pale river stone.\n\nWorn, the cluster shifts with every turn of the head: the faceted beads glint in changing light while the quartz drop swings gently below, a quiet shimmer rather than a flash. In crystal tradition, milky quartz and aquamarine are kept as stones of calm — worn with the intention of stillness amid a busy day.\n\nFinished on hypoallergenic 14k gold-plated sterling silver (S925) ear hooks with gold-plated alloy findings.

        "A statement-length drop of polished smoky quartz, cut into a slender, elongated teardrop that shifts from deep espresso to warm amber as light passes through it. At the crown, raw citrine chips glow pale gold, while a fringe of faceted tiger's eye and hematite cubes cascades down fine gold chain.\n\nThese earrings move beautifully — the long drops sway with every turn of the head, and the beaded cascade glints softly against the smooth, glassy stone. Smoky quartz is traditionally held as a grounding, protective stone, said to steady the wearer and quietly absorb what no longer serves.\n\nFinished on hypoallergenic 14k gold-plated sterling silver (S925) ear hooks with gold-plated alloy findings. Each pair is assembled by hand in Oxford, and because natural stone varies slightly, no two pairs are ever quite identical.",
